# DXA-2.1-.NET-With-Core-Module
This is a working .NET version of DXA 2.1 with the Core Module installed and all preliminary issues resolved. The intention is that this should run out-of-the-box with minimal configurations (just discovery service URL and credentials, and update the main project's startup URL to match Topology Manager BaseUrls)
